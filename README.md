### Predicting Heart Disease Using Machine Learning

#### Project Objective:
This project involves using machine learning to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on patient data. The primary goal was to explore the dataset, preprocess it effectively, and build predictive models to classify patients as at risk or not at risk for heart disease.

#### Key Steps and Highlights:
1. **Data Exploration and Preparation:**
   - Loaded a heart disease dataset with 303 rows and 14 columns.
   - Explored key questions such as:
     - What questions are we solving with this data?
     - How should different data types and missing values be handled?
     - How can features be added, removed, or engineered for better insights?
   - Analyzed potential outliers to assess their impact on model performance.

2. **Modeling and Evaluation:**
   - Trained multiple machine learning models, including:
     - Logistic Regression
     - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
     - Random Forest Classifier
   - Evaluated models using metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC curves.
   - Applied hyperparameter tuning (RandomizedSearchCV and GridSearchCV) to optimize model performance.

3. **Key Findings:**
   - Identified top-performing models and critical features influencing predictions.
   - Achieved high classification accuracy and insights into model trade-offs using confusion matrices and ROC curves.

## Visualizations:
1. **Correlation Heatmap:**
   - Displaying feature relationships, which is critical in understanding how attributes contribute to heart disease risk.
2. **Confusion Matrix:**
   - Demonstrating model performance with a clear breakdown of true positives, false positives, etc.
3. **ROC Curve:**
   - Showing the trade-off between true positive rate and false positive rate across different thresholds.
